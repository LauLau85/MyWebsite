				 So let's tell something about myself...

					<h2>Initiative</h2>					
					An initiative and active mind-set is key in life. I believe nearly any goal can be achieved, as long as you 
					go after it and work for it. Successful people don't have things happening to them, they happen to things.
					At the age of 18, I started my study Mechanical Engineering at the Technical University of Delft with the intention of
					building a career in the field of Robotics. 
				</div>
				
				<div class="page_p">
					At the present time, I have achieved my goal of becoming an Engineer. I am doing a specialization in Intelligent Mechanical
					Systems and designing a Robot as part of my Msc Thesis.  
					Mechatronics, and therefore Robotics, are becoming ever more sophisticated and their possibilities keep increasing. And 
					as Mechatronics and Robotics are growing more prominent in industry and every day life, I do my best to continue on this path.
				</div>
		
			
		
				<div class="page_p">
					<h2>The passion for Robotics</h2>
					Mechatronics is the combination of Mechanics, Electronics and Informatics. With Robotics being Mechatronics in its 
					ultimate form. This multi-disciplinary nature makes it a challenging field, but also very interesting. It requires versatility, flexibility 
					and good communication with people from other fields. You might be doing a dynamic simulation one day and the next day be studying
					magnetic fields. Each project is like an adventure and you learn something new.

					Like many people, my first introduction to robots was through movies. I was inspired by 
					<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091949/?ref_=nv_sr_1">Short Circuit</a> 
					and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083437/?ref_=tt_rec_tt">Knight Rider</a>, and the more real 
					<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robot_Wars_(TV_series)">RobotWars</a>  show after that. Those machines that could interact with
					people were fascinating. For my final high school project I made my first robot. It was a simple rover, made with a Lego Mindstorms kit, that could avoid obstacles on its path. But it was enough for me 
					to decide that this was what I wanted to do. And so I went to the Technical University of Delft.
				</div>
				
			
				<div class="page_p">
					<h2>A student from Delft</h2>
					I moved to Delft soon after the beginning of my study. Delft is a beautiful city to live and a stimulating environment for technical
					people. I joined a student society, where I've been the Treasurer, taken part in the Formula Student Racecar Team and build a robot for a 
					small RobotWars competition. Meanwhile I did my bachelor Mechanical Engineering.

				<div class="page_p">
					My master specialization is called Intelligent Mechanical Systems. This entails a combination of Control Theory, 
					Mechanical Systems Design and Programming courses.
					 The second year I did an internship in Chile with UAV's and currently I am doing my final Thesis with the 
					 <a href="http://robotics.tudelft.nl/?q=research/zebro-six-legged-robot">ZebRo</a> group. I will graduate before summer this year.
